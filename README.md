Trying to learn Android


To get the Uber and instagram demos working, a Bitnami Parse Server needs to be started on AWS.

The bluetooth demo works only on a real device, the emulators don't support bluetooth.

The firebase demo is only halfway done, may need to read the tutorials to get it finished.
